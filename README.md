# Heterosigma

Data repository for Giesler et al. (submitted) "Interactive effects of salinity, temperature and food web configuration on performance and harmfulness of the raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo" 

All experiments were conducted from 2019-2020 in the Plankton Ecology Lab, ICBM Terramare, Wilhelmshaven, Germany. For details about the experimental setups and experimental design please read the methods part of the paper which you can find on find on the preprint server (link will be attached soon). This repository comprises all raw data files from the experiments listed in the methods of the paper. R scripts for reproducing all statistical analysis will follow soon!

file 1 (data_competition_experiment.csv): contains cell densities and biovolume data of a growth experiment containing monocultures and polycultures of H. akashiwo and H. rotundata across two levels of temperature (16째C & 22째C) and salinity (15 & 30) over time.

file 3 (copepod_mainstudy_mortality_data.csv): contains counts of living and dead copepods (Acartia tonsa) in a grazing assay with different prey treatments (monocultures and polyculture of H. akashiwo and H. rotundata) across two levels of temperature (16째C & 22째C) and salinity (15 & 30) over time.

file 4 (copepod_mainstudy_grazing_data.csv): contains cell densities and biovolumes over time of the prey algae grazed by the copepods in the experiment described for file 3.

file 5 (copepod_mainstudy_growthstages_data.csv): contains information about the devolopmental stage of the copepods at the end of the experiment described for file 3.

file 6 (rotifer_assay_mortality_data.csv): contains counts of living and dead rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis) in a grazing assay with different prey treatments (monocultures and polyculture of H. akashiwo and H. rotundata) across two levels of salinity (15 & 30) over time.

file 7 (rotifer_assay_grazing_data.csv): contains cell densities and biovolumes over time of the prey algae grazed by the rotifers in the experiment described for file 6.
